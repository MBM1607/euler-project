# Introduction
These are my solution to the first 100 Euler project problems in C++.
Currently the Euler projcet only allows the publication of solution to just the first 100 problems
if that is removed then my solutions will also be probably updated.

## Style
My goal is to make modular re-usable solutions and therefore the general functionality common to
various problems will be made separate under different header files.

## Make
Make files are added for every problems so to compile any problem simply cd into the directory and
run make.
